# NYC Taxi Yellow Project
## 1. Introduction:
This project helps tracking the Taxi System through Power BI dashboard. The data will be updated regularly using my designed pipeline in Microsoft Fabric. 

## 2. Preview Images:

## 3. About Dataset:

The datasets contains yellow trip records in 2024, which include pickup and drop-off
dates/times, pickup and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment
types and driver-reported passenger counts. The dataset was collected and provided to NYC
Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab
& Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP). The data contains parquet files of
yellow trip recorded within each month followed by a taxi zone lookup table. Furthermore,
there was also a taxi zone lookup file that helps explaining the location id with borough, zone
and service zone. The datasource can be accessed [Here](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) or download in my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/minhD03/NYCTaxi_Yellow-Project/tree/cf2e4579d42d79dbeb3748a0bd6376449f71965e/Data)
